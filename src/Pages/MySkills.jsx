            Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 10 years
            ago, Iâ€™ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
            collaborated with talented people to create web products for both
            business and consumer use.
          </p>
          <p>
            I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use,
            and built with best practices. The main area of my expertise is
            front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web
            apps, custom plugins, features, animations, and coding interactive
            layouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have full-stack developer experience with popular open-source
            CMS like (WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Keystone.js and others) .
